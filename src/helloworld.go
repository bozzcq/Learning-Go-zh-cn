Just as \lstinline{package main} was required to be first, %
\lstinline{import} may come next. In Go, \lstinline{package} is always first, then %
\lstinline{import}, then everything else. %
When your Go program is executed, the first function called will be %
\lstinline{main.main()}, which mimics the behavior from C. Here we declare %
that function;}|

On line 8 we call a function from the package \package{fmt} to print a %
string to the screen. The string is enclosed with \lstinline{"} and may %
contain non-ASCII characters. Here we use Greek and Japanese.}|
